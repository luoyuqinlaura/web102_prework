## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It is well structured once you start. However, at the beginning, I am quite confused about the first secret key. I hope we can start directly from the challenge.



There are many way to achieve a specific thing, for example: make 800268 show 800.268. The truth is we can use other mathod instead of toLocaleString(). I hope there should be a more specific instruction on it.
